title: Reuse our Infrastructure
permalink: /reuse/

## 1. Want to reuse our infrastructure, adapt it to your data/workflows or modify it in any other way?

Feel free to use our [API](http://infolis.gesis.org/api) to upload your documents and extract links using our predefined set of patterns or by generating your own (see our [HowTo pages](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-web/wiki)).

If you want to integrate our API into your automated workflows for document processing or if you wish to make your own modifications, start [here](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-docker) by deploying your own instance of the InFoLiS infrastructure. To add your modifications, simply fork our respective github repositories ([Infolink](https://github.com/infolis/infoLink) for making adjustments to text mining algorithms or [infolis-web](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-web) for modifying the web service) and supply the location of your forked repositories in your [.gitmodules-file](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-docker/blob/master/.gitmodules).

## 2. Thinking about adapting InfoLink to generate links for scientific fields other than Social or Economic Sciences?

See our [guidelines](#) for a step by step introduction on how to accomplish that.


## 3. Already using our services or planning to do so?
We'd love to hear from you! 
Of course, you can also [get in touch with us](mailto:benjamin.zapilko@gesis.org) in case you have any questions.
