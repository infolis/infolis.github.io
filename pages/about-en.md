Duration of the Project
: * 2011 - 2013 (first phase)
  * 2014 - 2016 (second phase)

In the first project phase 
we developed heuristical algorithms to extract references to research
datasets from publications in the field of Social Science and to integrate
those links into the [Primo Search Portal of Mannheim University
Library](http://www.ub.uni-mannheim.de/133.html) and the [Datenbestandskatalog
of GESIS](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/index.asp). Figure 1 shows the basic idea behind the project. A user can search either in Primo or in the Datenbestandskatalog and gets both, relevant publications and research data. Further, they are linked to each other to know which research data is mentioned in which publication and vice versa.

In the current phase of the project, the <a class="page-link" href="/about-goals/">goal</a> is to extend the results of the
previous project, in terms of quality, quantity and supported languages.
Furthermore, the technical infrastructure will be developed further to provide
a solid and vendor-independent foundation for the algorithms. Last but not
least, the nature of publication-dataset links will be thoroughly examined and
formalized to allow more fine-grained description of these links.

Figure 2 shows why linkging research data can be difficult, i.e. due to its granularity.
